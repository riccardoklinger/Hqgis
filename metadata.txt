description=Routing, Geocoding, POI search, Isochrones with the HERE API.
version=1.2.1
author=Riccardo Klinger

about=Access the HERE API from inside QGIS using your own HERE-API key. Currently supports Geocoding, Routing, POI-search and isochrone analysis.
Attention: The plugin needs to have credentials from HERE. Therefore you need to register a freemium account (free of charge at HERE.com). Fill in the generated API key in the credentials-tab of the plugin.
